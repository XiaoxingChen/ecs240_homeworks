# ECS240 Programming Assignment 2

## Task Planning
1. Input and output 
    - Andersen algorithm ($\checkmark$)
    - Chakaravarthy's algorithm
2. Rewrite the statements and extend the reference and dereference
3. Andersen's algorithm
    - address_of(dict, statement)
    - copy(dict, statement)
    - assign(dict, statement)
    - deference(dict, statement)
4. Chakaravarthy's algorithm (to discuss data structure)
    - Direct assignments
    - Copying statements
    - Edge computation
    - Forbidden Pair computation (?)

5. Data structures (dict and set)
6. Note: There are some differences between Q1 and Q2, maybe we need another class and input parser
7. Test (find some examples in lecture slides)
