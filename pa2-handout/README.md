2. one start operation: extend N pointers to M pointers
3. Andersen's algorithm
    - address_of(dict, statement)
    - copy(dict, statement)
    - assign(dict, statement)
    - deference(dict, statement)
4. Chakaravarthy's algorithm (to discuss data structure)
    - Direct assignments
    - Copying statements
    - Edge computation
    - Forbidden Pair computation (?)

5. Data structures (dict and set)
6. Test (find some examples in lecture slides)
